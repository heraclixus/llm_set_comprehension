# Goal

The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of a LLM on the task of evaluting set-level operations. 

Examples of set-level operations:
- Union
- Intersection
- Difference
- Symmetric Difference
- Cartesian Product
- Power Set
- etc.

Then we craft examples of neural-symbolic tasks that require set-level operations, examples are multihop query answering tasks. 

We then evaluate the performance of a LLM on these tasks, and compare it to a baseline of running the same queries with neural-symbolic reasoning models.
